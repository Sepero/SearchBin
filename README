SearchBin is a fast commandline program for searching within binary files. It's a bit like grep for binaries.

It has three capabilities for searching.
-Search for bytes using hexidecimal
-Search for a plain text string
-Search for a smaller binary file


Syntax:
searchbin.py -t PATTERN [FILE [FILE...]]
searchbin.py -p PATTERN [FILE [FILE...]]
searchbin.py -f FILE    [FILE [FILE...]]


EXAMPLES
Search for the hex bytes "FF14DE" in the file gamefile.db:
$ ./searchbin.py -p "FF14DE" gamefile.db
Match at offset:            907          38B in  gamefile.db
Match at offset:           1881          759 in  gamefile.db
Match at offset:           7284         1C74 in  gamefile.db
Match at offset:           7420         1CFC in  gamefile.db
Match at offset:           8096         1FA0 in  gamefile.db


The printed offsets are listed in decimal and hexidecimal formats.
You can also search for unknown patterns with "??". Just insert them where ever you have an unknown byte:
$ ./searchbin.py -p "FF??DE" gamefile.db


You can search through multiple files at once, and search piped input:
$ ./searchbin.py -p "FF??EE" gamefile.db supersecret.idx
$ cat gamefile.db | ./searchbin -p "FF??EE"


You can also search using regular text strings and other binary files.
$ ./searchbin.py -t "hello" gamefile.db
$ ./searchbin.py -f binaryfile gamefile.db


Options of SearchBin:

$ ./searchbin.py --help

Optional Arguments:
  -h, --help            show help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  file to read search pattern from
  -t PATTERN, --text PATTERN
                        a (non-unicode case-sensitive) text string to search
                        for
  -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN
                        a hexidecimal pattern to search for
  -b NUM, --buffer-size NUM
                        read buffer size (in bytes). default is 8388608 (8MB)
  -s NUM, --start NUM   starting position in file to begin searching
  -e NUM, --end NUM     end search at this position, measuring from beginning
                        of file
  -m NUM, --max-count NUM
                        maximum number of matches to find
  -l FILE, --log FILE   write matched offsets to FILE, instead of standard
                        output
  -v, --verbose         verbose, output the number of bytes searched after
                        each buffer read
  -V, --version         print version information



Extra Notes:
An argument -t or -p or -f is required. The -p argument accepts a 
hexidecimal pattern string and allows for missing characters, 
such as 'FF??FF'. When using -f argument, the pattern file will 
be read as a binary file (not hex strings). If no search files are 
specified, %prog will read from standard input. The minimum memory 
required is about 3 times the size of the pattern byte length. 
Increasing buffer-size will increase program search speed for 
large search files. All size arguments (-b -s -e) are read in decimal 
format, for example: '-s 1024' will start searching after 1kilobyte.
Pattern files do not allow for wildcard matching.
Reported matches are displayed as 0-based offset.



Further Examples:
Search for the text string "Tom" in myfile.exe. Text is case sensitive.
./searchbin.py -t "Tom" myfile.exe


Search for the text string "T?m" in myfile.exe, where ? is a wildcard. This will match "Tom" "Tim" "Twm" and all other variations, including non-printing bytes.
./searchbin.py -t "T?m" myfile.exe


Search for the hexidecimal pattern "AABBCCDDEE" in myfile.exe.
./searchbin.py -p "AABBCCDDEE" myfile.exe


Searches for the hexidecimal pattern "AA??CC??EE" in myfile.exe, where ?? can be any byte value.
./searchbin.py -p "AA??CC??EE" myfile.exe


Takes the binary file pattern.bin, and searches for an exact match within myfile.exe.
./searchbin.py -f pattern.bin myfile.exe


Features:
+No compiling necessary
+Requires Python 2.7 or Python 3
+Less code
+Search in files of unlimited size
+See the matched pattern when you use wildcard "??"

This program is no longer being maintained. I attempted to make the code easily readable and well documented. Please fork it and make something even greater!
